ZF2 Tutorial with Spiffy Doctrine
=================================

This is a sample application using the [Zendframework Skeleton Application](https://github.com/zendframework/ZendSkeletonApplication) and [Rob Allen's ZF2 tutorial](http://akrabat.com/getting-started-with-zend-framework-2/). However instead of using Zend\Db\Table it uses [SpiffyDoctrine](https://github.com/SpiffyJr/SpiffyDoctrine) and [SpiffyDoctrineORM](https://github.com/SpiffyJr/SpiffyDoctrineORM) for the database handling.
